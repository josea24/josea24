I'm a web developer with a career in systems engineering from UNEFA-Aragua, Venezuela, I'm a fan of learning new things.

I've worked on this for more than 2 years. I have used Laravel, NodeJs, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Wordpress in my previous experiences

I believe that to achieve each objective of a project there must be good communication between the entire development team (I really like work teams) and that there must be a playful and coordinated atmosphere, where everyone can give voice to their ideas without fear.

As personal entertainment, I love to practice sports, especially basketball, it is one of the sports that I practice the most lately, in the same way, I also love to watch series and movies, my favorite genres are action, suspense, and fiction
